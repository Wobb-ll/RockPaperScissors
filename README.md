In this project I will be creating the game Rock, Paper, Scissors.

It will be played in the Console, so no majot HTML elements are needed.

then the code will randomly pick its choice. 
The choices will be compared and the winner will be chosen based off of the following:

Rock > Scissors > Paper > Rock
